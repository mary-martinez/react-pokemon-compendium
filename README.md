# Compendium Planning

- Get my list of pokemon showing up on the page
  1.  write your fetch function -- validate with console.log
  1.  addUseEffect and set state with the response
  1.  map through your state and display the name
  1.  build out your PokeCard component -- use static values
  1.  map through your items and display PokeCard
- Build out types dropdown
  1. getTypes from the API
  1. call getTypes and set in state
  1. make state for selected dropdown
  1. make a dropdown with the types and selected dropdown
  1. add useEffect to call API when the dropdown changes

## General Flow

1. make a state variable
1. make UX to allow user to change that state variable
1. add state variable to useEffect dependency array so API is refreshed when state changes
